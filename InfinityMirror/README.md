# Infinity Mirror

## Short introduction about project

Infinity Mirror is my final project for the Introduction to Robotics course. The main idea is that we use one mirror, a RGB led strip and one glass with 70% reflection. We put the led strip between mirror and glass and that is how we create the infinity leds effect.
