# Details about my homeworks

# First homework:

  Control a RGB led with 3 potentiometers.
  
  This shows you how to read from three analog input pins, map the result to a range from 0 to 255, use that result to set the pulse width   modulation (PWM) of three output pins to dim or brighten an RGB LED and print the values on the serial monitor of the Arduino Software.
  
  Hardware Required:
      
      1. RGB led
      2. 3x Resistors (recommended 220ohm)
      3. Wires
      4. 3x Potentiometers
      5. Arduino
      6. Connector cable

# Second homework:
  
  Play a tune when passive piezo buzzer detect knock's.
  
  After 5 seconds since knock detection, passive piezo buzzers will start play a tune which have frequency 1000. We use tone() function     for that.
  You can stop the tune when you press the PULL_UP button.
  
  Hardware Required:
      
      1. 1x Passive buzzer for knock detection
      2. 1x Active buzzer for sound
      3. 1x Pushbutton
      4. 2x Resistors, for buzzers (recommended 100ohm)
      5. Wires
      6. Arduino
      7. Connector cable
      
# Third homework:

  Control a 4 digits 7-segments led display with a joystick.
  
  This program is individually controlling each digit of the segment with the joystick. Use the X-axis, cycle through the digits and chose which one to modify. We light up the DP led of the current position so we know what digit is selected. When the button is pressed again, the selected digit is locked. After that, use the Y-axis to modify the value of the digit, both up and down. Press the button again to unlock the selection and be able to cycle through the 4 digits.
  
  Hardware Required:
    
      1. 1x 4 digits 7-segments display
      2. 1x Joystick
      3. 4x Resistors (330ohm)
      4. Wires
      5. Arduino
      6. Connector cable
