# First homework:

  Control a RGB led with 3 potentiometers.
  
  This shows you how to read from three analog input pins, map the result to a range from 0 to 255, use that result to set the pulse width   modulation (PWM) of three output pins to dim or brighten an RGB LED and print the values on the serial monitor of the Arduino Software.
  
  Hardware Required:
      
      1. RGB led
      2. Arduino
      3. 3 Resistors (220 ohm)
      4. Wires
      5. 3 Potentiometers
