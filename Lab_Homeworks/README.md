# Details about my homeworks

# First homework:

  Control a RGB led with 3 potentiometers.
  
  This shows you how to read from three analog input pins, map the result to a range from 0 to 255, use that result to set the pulse width   modulation (PWM) of three output pins to dim or brighten an RGB LED and print the values on the serial monitor of the Arduino Software.
  
  Hardware Required:
      
      1. RGB led
      2. 3x Resistors (220 ohm)
      3. Wires
      4. 3x Potentiometers
      5. Arduino
      6. Connector cable

# Second homework:
  
  Play a tune when passive piezo buzzer detect knock's.
  
  After 5 seconds since knock detection, passive piezo buzzers will start play a tune which have frequency 1000. We use tone() function     for that.
  You can stop the tune when you press the PULL_UP button.
  
  Hardware Required:
      
      1. 1x Passive buzzer for knock detection
      2. 1x Active buzzer for sound
      3. 1x Pushbutton
      4. 2x Resistors, for buzzers (recommended 100ohm)
      5. Wires
      6. Arduino
      7. Connector cable
