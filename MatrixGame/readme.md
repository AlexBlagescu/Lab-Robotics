# Monster Invaders

# Description:

  The game will start with one ship which is positioned in middle of the matrix, posiiton (4, 4). The monsters will come from sides and they will try to reach you whereever you go. You can move anywhere on the matrix. You have different weapons and you can swap them when you push the button. For the moment, I am thinking of two weapons.One of them is shooting multiple bullets in some range(aoe damage) and another one will shot in a single direction giving solo damage.Your ship fire is continuously. Your life will go down if the monsters will reach and hit you. The game is over when you have 0% life.
